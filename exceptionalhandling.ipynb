    "When to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "I/O-Bound Tasks: Multithreading is ideal for tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for I/O operations, such as reading from a disk, network operations, or user input. This is because threads can run concurrently, allowing one thread to perform I/O while another thread continues processing.\n",
    "Shared Memory: If your tasks need to share a lot of data, multithreading can be more efficient since threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "Lightweight Tasks: Threads are generally lighter than processes, so if you have many small tasks, multithreading can be more efficient.\n",
    "Real-Time Systems: In systems where tasks need to be completed in a specific order or within a certain time frame, multithreading can be beneficial due to its lower overhead compared to multiprocessing.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A web server handling multiple client requests simultaneously.\n",
    "Multiprocessing\n",
    "When to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU-Bound Tasks: Multiprocessing is better for tasks that require a lot of CPU time, such as complex calculations or data processing. This is because each process runs on a separate CPU core, allowing true parallelism.\n",
    "Isolation: If tasks need to be isolated from each other to avoid issues like race conditions or deadlocks, multiprocessing is preferable since each process has its own memory space.\n",
    "Scalability: For applications that need to scale across multiple CPUs or machines, multiprocessing can be more effective.\n",
    "Fault Tolerance: If one process crashes, it doesn’t affect the others, making multiprocessing more robust for certain applications.\n",
